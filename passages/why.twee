:: Why
This module focuses on playable stories and their potential to create new forms of interactions with interfaces, virtual environments and objects. Throughout this semester, you will learn how to lead an interactive project from its conceptual phase to its final form. This module is articulated with Laboratoire Electronique: this means that you will be able to create a functional interactive experience.
